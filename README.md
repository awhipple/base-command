Itemization / ArcPlan

Everything goes by reactor tiers. Each level of reactor is another tier of game play.
This is to control difficulty arc, and required idle/play time.

Reactor power is assigned by clicking on synth. This will expire after 1 min, so can't let it idle long.
Furthermore, completing a level should grant 5x game play times power. You can play idle or play idle + levels to advance.
